ASA bibiliography style file that includes support for DOIs

I have here a modified version of the ASA (American Statistical Association) bibliography style file with added support for including DOI links in bibliography entries. I provide no guarantees about this file's desirability for the journal. 

The original file contains the following copyright information:

* Brett Presnell, 24 August 1998 (presumably for the ASA modifications)
* Copyright (C) 1994-98 Patrick W. Daly (presumably the original template)

With the proviso: 

```
 % NOTICE:  
 % This file may be used for non-profit purposes.  
 % It may not be distributed in exchange for money,  
 %   other than distribution costs.  
 %  
 % The author provides it `as is' and does not guarantee it in any way.

```

Govern yourselves accordingly!

I provide the following files:

* `asadoi.bst`: the bibliography style file.
* `example.bib`: an example BiBTeX file.
* `example.tex`: an example LaTeX file.
